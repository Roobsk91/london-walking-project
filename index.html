                    <h2>Why London?</h2>
                    <h3>London, one of Europe's greenest cities</h3>
                    <p>There are a lot of things London thinks it does best but actually falls a tiny bit short. We
                        don't have the cheapest
                        rents, or many 24-hour nightclubs and our transport system seems to be permanently disrupted.
                        But, if there's one thing
                        we do excel at, it's our lovely, lovely parks. Everyone knows London has got loads of parks. In
                        fact, a new study has revealed that we’ve got the most green spaces out of any European city.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        London’s parks, canals, reservoirs and riversides form an important network of spaces and public
                        places. Alongside London’s trees, these green and riverside spaces play a valuable role in
                        improving the quality, character and economy of the capital.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        With 3,000 parks of varying sizes designated by the boroughs as ‘public open space’, London is a
                        green city. Together they cover almost 18 per cent of London which is more than the area of the
                        city covered by railways and roads combined

                            <h4>Greenwich Park</h4>
                            <p>Overlooking the River Thames and home to some of London’s most iconic views, Greenwich
                                Park is an amazing mix of 17th century landscape, stunning gardens and a rich history
                                that dates back to Roman times.
                                <br>
                                Follow in the footsteps of England’s kings and queens with a walk through ancient
                                tree avenues. Visit the tranquil Flower, Herb and Rose Gardens , explore the Park’s
                                wildlife or enjoy a snack at the

                            <p>Though one of the hillier of London's parks, Greenwich is a beautiful spot that has
                                something for everyone.
                                Flower gardens, large ponds, open-spaces to roam; and even a few deer tucked away for
                                the wildlife lovers.

                            <h4>Stave Hill Ecology Park</h4>
                            <p>Stave Hill Ecological Park is managed by TCV’s Urban Ecology team as a nature reserve,
                                educational facility, research
                                area and place of recreation. The Park has been designed and managed to form a mosaic of
                                grassland, woodland, scrub and
                                wetland habitats which support a wide variety of wildlife.

                            <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                            <p>This ecological park is a bit of a hidden gem for those not from the Rotherhithe area.
                                However, it's well worth the visit, as it is an
                                important sitew for wildlife and biodiversity. The top of stave-hill, while a bit of a
                                climb on a hot day, offers fantastic views of the city.</p>

                            <p>Yes, this may be one of the few of London's green spaces that costs to enter, but it is
                                defaintely a must-see for anyone who loves plants and a beautiful, long stroll. It
